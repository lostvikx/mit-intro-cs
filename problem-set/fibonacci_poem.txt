I
a
be
toy
for u
to play,
around your 1
thin finger, which is
like the snow, that brushed off my
bright red face during the winter dance last night, now
there is no denying in the fact that I have completely fallen for you. My beloved, I have
tried and failed multiple times to make you the most treasured piece of my heart, but still clinging onto the hope, of living together with you.
